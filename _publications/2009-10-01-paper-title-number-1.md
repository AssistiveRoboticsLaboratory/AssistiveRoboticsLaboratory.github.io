Traditional control methodologies for rehabilitation orthoses/exoskeletons aim to replicate normative joint kinematics and thus fall into the category of kinematic control. This control paradigm depends on pre-defined reference trajectories, which can be difficult to adjust between different locomotor tasks and human subjects. These strategies tend to compensate for chronic deficits rather than enable training and recovery of normative gait. A paradigm shift from task-specific, kinematic control approaches to task-invariant, energetic control approaches is needed for wearable robots to assist their human users across activities. Therefore, we are investigating a novel control methodology for shaping the potential energy or total energy of the human body with wearable actuators. Because this control method does not depend on pre-defined kinematic patterns, it is ideally suited for task-invariant control of exoskeletons, both for performance augmentation and rehabilitation purposes. In this paradigm, wearable actuators can reduce mass/inertia parameters in body energetics to dynamically offload the weight of a stroke patient who otherwise would be supported by multiple therapists during gait rehabilitation. This innovation in dynamics and control will enable powered orthoses to assist humans in a variety of activities, which cannot be achieved with state-of-art control strategies based on pre-defined, task-specific joint kinematics.
