User safety is a crucial factor to consider when designing control paradigms for lower-limb exoskeletons. Existing control paradigms of lower-limb exoskeletons mainly focus on providing assistance for human users under stable walking conditions, ignoring situations that human users may lose their balance due to external perturbations during walking. In this letter, we propose a safety framework for lower-limb exoskeletons to augment human safety based on Control Barrier Functions. The safety index is defined as the center of mass and swing foot position lying within a human user’s self-selected ranges. Instead
of enforcing reference trajectories, we incorporate human inputs and preferences in a two-layer control structure based on Control Barrier Functions to facilitate safety augmentation for volitional human motion. Simulation results on a human wearing an exoskeleton demonstrate that the proposed control paradigm can generate assistance to maintain balance for human users while undergoing gait perturbations, or recover from an initial unsafe posture.
